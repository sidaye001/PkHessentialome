# PkHessentialome
**This page provide instructions for running statistical and mathematical analysis on Tn-Seq data of Plasmodium knowlesi H strain essentialome and drug perturbation.The analysis are as follows:**

- Preprocessing before essentiality modelling
- Hidden Markov Model for coldspots identification
- Hidden Markov Model for depleted regions identification
- Motif analysis
- MMIS modelling
- OIS modelling
- HMS modelling
- FIS modelling
- lncRNA analysis
- genomic deletion analysis
- Perturbation analysis
- Comparative essentialomes analysis
- Figures

**Running the code:**

To install the code please clone the library by copy-pasting the following in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/umbibio/PkHessentialome.git

**Data availability**
The processed data is available here and can be used to run the analysis pipeline smoothly and generate the figures in the paper. We suggest that you save the rds folder within the same directory where the code is cloned. Alternatively, change the relative path in the code.
